            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Collin Jones, and I am a second-year Computer Science and Information
               Technology &amp; Web Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Although it is
               only my second year at RPI, I anticipate graduating a year early in May 2019. I am from
               Gorham, Maine, located just outside of Maine's largest city, Portland.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I'm a guitar player, runner, and scouter, earning my Eagle Scout award in
               October of 2012, my freshman year of High School. I also enjoy everything outdoors,
               including camping, hiking, fishing, and cooking.</p>

            <h3>RateMyCourses</h3>
            <p>RateMyCourses is a tool for students to use to decide which courses to take based on
               other students' past experiences. Students could enter the website to read ratings and
               reviews on courses for any university, as well as post their own ratings and reviews. This
               was built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and PHP. Although I touched on all aspects of the
               project, my main focus was on the PHP and JavaScript/AJAX. This was a project for Web
               Systems Development in the Fall of 2017.</p>

            <h3>Paint By Pairs Solver</h3>
            <p>In C++ using recursion, I wrote a program to find all possible solutions to a game called
               Paint by Pairs. As part of this assignment, I optimized my program to solve the puzzles
               quicker, and I found ways to minimize the amount of memory I used. This was a homework
               assignment for Data Structures in the Fall of 2016.</p>

            <h3>RPI Fixxer</h3>
            <p>RPI Fixxer is an online ticketing system for the school's maintenance team that users
               can log into via the school's authentication service and submit repair requests. Workers can
               then view that request, claim the request, and produce status updates on that job. Admins
               could see what jobs were taken by which workers to track productivity. This was a project
               for Introduction to ITWS in the Fall of 2016.</p>
