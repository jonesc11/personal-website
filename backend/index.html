        <h1>I'm a Computer Science Major.</h1><h2>What does that mean?</h2>
        <p style="top: 27vh;">In this part of my education, I learn many different programming languages, and how to code so that my programs are functional and efficient.</p>
        <p style="top: 37vh;">I am confident in my skills in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li style="top: 54vh; left: 14.5vw;">Java</li>
          <li style="top: 54vh; left: 43vw;">C/C++</li>
          <li style="top: 54vh; left: 71.5vw;">Python</li>

      <h1>How'd I start?</h1>
      <div id="writing">
        <p>In seventh grade, I played a lot of Minecraft. I bought my own Minecraft server and wanted to modify my server to my exact specifications</p>
        <p>So naturally, I began making plugins for my server using Java. These plugins handled player interactions with everything in the server, and opened my eyes to object-oriented programming.
           In high school, I took more classes in object-oriented programming and refined my skills from my self-learned base.</p>
        <p>Since then, I started school at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and I'm now studying Computer Science as one of my majors, and I've had multiple projects since then...</p>

          <h2>Solving Paint by Pairs</h2>
          <p>In C++ using recursion, I wrote a program to find all possible solutions to a game called Paint by Pairs. This was a homework assignment for my Data Structures course that I took
             in the fall semester of 2016. As part of this assignment, I optimized my program to solve the puzzles quicker, and I found ways to minimize the amount of memory I used.</p>

        <div class="project" style="bottom: 20vh; right: 10vw;">
          <h2>Likeable Local</h2>
          <p>In the spring of 2016, I participated in an internship with Likeable Local. The thing that I worked the most on was using Python to pull data from Facebook's interests and likes and
          determine whether or not certain interests would be useful for advertising. For example, if I searched "Law", "Lawyer" would be useful, but not "Jennifer Lawrence."</p>
