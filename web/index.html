        <h1>I'm an ITWS Major.</h1><h2>What does that mean?</h2>
        <p style="top: 27vh;">In this part of my education, I learn about information systems, IT structure, web design, and much more.</p>
        <p style="top: 37vh;">I am confident in my skills in:</p>

      <h1>How'd I start?</h1>
      <div id="writing">
        <p>In sixth grade, I starting playing with extremely basic HTML. At first, I just enjoyed making a bunch of links talk to each other.</p>
        <p>As middle school progressed, I started to work on more complicated websites. One of my friends asked me to make a website for his gaming server, and this was my first real project.
           In this project, I played with many, many more CSS styling options, and started making websites that not only functioned, but also looked good.</p>
        <p>Since then, I started school at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and I'm now studying Web Science as one of my majors, and I've had multiple projects since then...</p>

          <h2>Introduction to ITWS Term Project </h2>
          <p>In the fall semester of 2016, I worked with two other group members on my term project for one of my classes. This was a ticketing system for the school's maintenance program,
          which worked with dynamic MySQL databases and the school's authentification system. I worked mainly on the front-end HTML and CSS.</p>

          <h2>Transferring GWI's Website</h2>
          <p>A few years ago, I was asked to help update GWI's website to the WordPress platform. This involved making all of the links and images linked relative and making sure there were no formatting issues.</p>
